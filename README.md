# Yerd

**A fast, rootless, open-source local PHP development environment.**

Serve your projects on `.test` domains over HTTP **and** HTTPS, run a different
PHP version per site, and manage it all from one tiny daemon — no Docker, no
`sudo` for everyday work, no subscription.

## Why Yerd?

If you've used [Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com), you know the appeal:
type a URL like `https://my-app.test` and your site just works, with the right
PHP version and a trusted certificate. Yerd brings that same frictionless
experience — but **cross-platform, fully open-source, and rootless by design.**

- 🚀 **Zero-config sites.** Drop a project in a parked directory and it's instantly
  live at `<name>.test`.
- 🔒 **HTTPS that just works.** A local certificate authority issues per-site
  certificates automatically — no `mkcert` dance, no browser warnings once trusted.
- 🐘 **Any PHP, per site.** Install multiple PHP versions and pin each site to the
  one it needs.
- 🪶 **Lightweight & native.** A single ~8 MB static daemon. No containers, no VM,
  no Electron.
- 🛡️ **Rootless.** Setup elevates **once**; everything after runs as your user.
- 🔍 **Self-diagnosing.** `yerd status` and `yerd doctor` tell you exactly what's
  running and how to fix what isn't.

<sub>✅\* = on the Yerd [roadmap](#roadmap). Everything without an asterisk works today on macOS and Linux.</sub>
<br><sub>**Lerd** runs your stack in containers via **Podman/Docker** — so it's
cross-platform and trivially adds database/cache services, but it pulls and runs
container images rather than native processes. † Rootless when run on rootless
Podman.</sub>
<br><sub>**On Laravel Valet:** Valet is the original macOS-only Laravel dev tool
(nginx + dnsmasq, installed via Homebrew/Composer). None of the three require it —
Herd is the native standalone successor that bundles its own nginx (and reuses
Valet's framework "drivers"), Lerd runs everything in containers, and Yerd uses
its own Rust proxy + DNS. No Valet, no Homebrew.</sub>

## Installation

> **The Yerd daemon runs entirely as your user — never as root.** `sudo` shows up
> in exactly two places, neither of them ongoing: installing the system package
> (standard for *any* `apt`/`.deb` package), and a single **one-time** setup step.
> Day-to-day use needs no elevation. Prefer no `sudo` at all? See
> [No system package](#from-source--no-system-package).

### Debian / Ubuntu (`.deb`)

```bash
# 1. Install the package (standard system install — writes to /usr/bin):
sudo dpkg -i yerd_2.0.1_amd64.deb

# 2. Start the per-user daemon (runs as you, not root):
systemctl --user enable --now yerd
loginctl enable-linger "$USER"          # optional: keep it running after logout
```

The package's post-install step grants `yerdd` the `cap_net_bind_service`
capability so the **unprivileged** daemon can bind ports 80/443 — re-applied
automatically on every upgrade. If that's unavailable, Yerd falls back to
`8080`/`8443` (and `yerd doctor` tells you).

### One-time setup

Run this **once** for the full experience. It's the only command that uses root,
and each part is independent:

```bash
sudo yerd elevate            # trust the local CA · route *.test · allow 80/443
# …or pick pieces:  sudo yerd elevate trust | resolver | ports
```

This mirrors the one-time admin step Herd and Valet also need — reconfiguring the
system DNS resolver and trusting a local certificate can't be done rootlessly.
After it, `yerd` never touches root again.

### From source / no system package

Don't want a system package (or any `sudo` to install)? Build and drop the
binaries on your `PATH` — no root required:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/forjedio/yerd
cd yerd
cargo build --release
install -Dm755 target/release/{yerd,yerdd,yerd-helper} -t ~/.local/bin
yerdd serve &                # rootless; runs on 8080/8443 out of the box
```

`cargo xtask deb` produces a `.deb` instead if you'd rather package it. (Browser
`*.test` resolution and trusted HTTPS still need the one-time `sudo yerd elevate`
above, or you can drive sites directly on `127.0.0.1:8080`.)

> PHP itself is **not** bundled — Yerd downloads prebuilt, static PHP builds on
> demand when you run `yerd install php`. Installing Yerd is tiny and fast.

---

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Install a PHP version and make it the default
yerd install php 8.5
yerd use 8.5

# 2a. Park a directory — every sub-folder becomes <folder>.test
yerd park ~/Sites
#     ~/Sites/blog  ->  http://blog.test

# 2b. …or link a single project under a name you choose
yerd link my-app ~/code/my-app
#     ->  http://my-app.test

# 3. Turn on HTTPS for a site
yerd secure my-app
#     ->  https://my-app.test  (trusted, thanks to the local CA)

# 4. Pin one site to a different PHP version
yerd use my-app 8.3

# 5. See what's going on / fix problems
yerd status
yerd doctor
yerd doctor fix
```

Open `https://my-app.test` in your browser — that's it.

## Principles

Yerd is built around a few deliberate decisions that make it safe, fast, and
maintainable.

### 🛡️ Rootless, with a tight privilege boundary

Yerd runs as **three** pieces, and the GUI/daemon **never** run as root:

- **`yerdd`** — the unprivileged per-user daemon. It owns all runtime state and
  serves the proxy, DNS, and PHP-FPM pools.
- **`yerd`** — the CLI, a thin client that just talks to the daemon over a
  per-user socket.
- **`yerd-helper`** — a strict, auditable one-shot binary for the handful of
  operations that genuinely need root (trust the CA, configure the DNS resolver,
  grant the port capability). It takes typed arguments, never shells out, never
  touches the network, does exactly one thing, and exits.

Setup may elevate **once**; daily use never does.

### 🔒 HTTPS without the hassle

Yerd generates a local certificate authority and issues a leaf certificate per
site on demand, terminated by a hand-rolled `rustls` reverse proxy.
`sudo yerd elevate trust` adds the CA to your system trust store — after that,
every `.test` site is green-padlock valid. **No OpenSSL anywhere.**

### 🧠 One source of truth

The daemon owns state. The CLI (and the future GUI) are *clients* — they never
reimplement daemon logic, so the CLI and GUI can never disagree.

### 🧩 A clean, testable core

> **Pure logic lives in library crates. I/O and OS calls are pushed to the edges
> behind traits.**

Business logic is unit-tested with in-memory fakes; real filesystem, network,
process, and OS calls live behind traits (`ProcessSpawner`, `TrustStore`,
`ResolverInstaller`, `PortBinder`, `Clock`, …) with one implementation per OS.
The result: a large, fast test suite and behaviour that's identical across
platforms.

### 🔕 Local and quiet

Yerd makes no network calls except the ones you explicitly ask for (downloading
the PHP builds you install). PHP updates are **notify-only** — Yerd tells you when
a newer patch exists, but never installs anything behind your back.

```

| Concern | Choice |
|---|---|
| Core language | Rust (edition 2021, MSRV 1.77) |
| TLS / local CA | `rustls` + `rcgen` (never OpenSSL) |
| Reverse proxy | hand-rolled `hyper` + `hyper-util` + `tokio-rustls` |
| DNS | `hickory-dns` embedded resolver for `*.test` |
| PHP runtime | `static-php-cli` builds, PHP-FPM per version |
| IPC | Unix socket / Windows named pipe via `interprocess` |
| GUI (roadmap) | Tauri v2 + Vue 3 + TypeScript + Tailwind |

---

## Roadmap

Shipping today (macOS + Linux): multi-version PHP, parked/linked `.test` sites,
HTTP + HTTPS with a local CA, the embedded DNS resolver, `status`/`doctor`, and
the Debian package.

On the way:

- 🖥️ **Desktop GUI** — a Tauri v2 menu-bar/tray app over the same daemon.
- 🗄️ **Service supervision** — MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, and Redis as
  Yerd-managed native processes (no Docker).
- 🪟 **Windows support** — NRPT-based resolver, named-pipe IPC, system cert store,
  TCP-loopback PHP-FPM.
- 📦 **More installers** — `.dmg`, `.AppImage`, and signed/notarised builds.

---

## Development

```bash
# The full CI gate (all must pass):
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace

# Build a .deb locally:
cargo xtask deb
```

Conventions: `thiserror` in libraries / `anyhow` only at binary top level; no
`unwrap`/`expect`/`panic` outside tests (clippy-enforced); pure crates stay pure;
the IPC wire format is a versioned, byte-pinned contract.

---

## Lineage

Yerd v2 is a ground-up rewrite of **our own v1 package**
([`LumoSolutions/yerd`](https://github.com/LumoSolutions/yerd)) — the Go tool we
first built to scratch this itch. Shipping v1 taught us a lot, and we rebuilt Yerd
from scratch in Rust to make it cross-platform, rootless, and far easier to
maintain. v1 is reference-only: there's no command-surface or config-format
compatibility. Where v1 built PHP from source and leaned on `sudo` for most
operations, v2 ships prebuilt PHP and runs unprivileged.
